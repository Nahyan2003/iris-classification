🌸 Iris Classification Project
📌 Project Overview

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning and data analytics.
This project aims to classify iris flowers into three species:

Iris-setosa

Iris-versicolor

Iris-virginica

using four features:

Sepal Length

Sepal Width

Petal Length

Petal Width

We applied different machine learning algorithms to evaluate which model performs best.

⚙️ Tools & Technologies

Language: Python

IDE: VS Code (Jupyter Notebook)

Libraries:

NumPy, Pandas (data processing)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (visualization)

Scikit-learn (model building & evaluation)

📊 Dataset

Samples: 150

Classes: 3 species (50 each)

Features: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width

Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository

🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized feature distributions and relationships.

Found Petal Length and Petal Width are most important for classification.

Heatmap showed strong correlation between petal features.

🛠️ Steps in the Project

Data loading and cleaning

Data exploration & visualization

Feature preprocessing (scaling with StandardScaler)

Splitting dataset into training & testing sets

Training models (KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression)

Model evaluation with confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV for KNN)

Feature importance analysis (Random Forest)

Decision boundary visualization (KNN)

Reporting and documentation

🤖 Model Performance

KNN (k=3) → 100% accuracy

Random Forest → 98–100% accuracy

SVM → 97–99% accuracy

Decision Tree → 97–100% accuracy

Logistic Regression → 92–95% accuracy

✅ Best Models: KNN, Random Forest, SVM

📌 Conclusion

The Iris dataset is well-suited for classification tasks.

KNN performed perfectly, but Random Forest & SVM are more robust for real-world use.

Petal features (length & width) are the key predictors.

🚀 Future Work

Deploy as a web application (Flask/Django)

Try PCA for dimensionality reduction

Experiment with neural networks
